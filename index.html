<p><i>Interesting fact about camel</i></p>
<ul>
   <li>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian
      camels.</li>
   <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their 
     eyes.</li>   
   <li>Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't 
     eat.</li>
   <li>The amount of water a camel drinks on a day-to-day basis can vary greatly, as they drink 
     to replace only the fluid they’ve lost. A thirsty camel can drink up to 135 liters in one 
     sitting.</li>
